## mbeddr installer

This is the mbeddr installer source code it is written in C# compatible with .Net 2.0.

The code is normally build as a .Net 4.0 binary to run ootb on Windows Vista+ which ship with .Net 4.0 preinstalled. 

The project can be build either with Visual Studio Express (www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deu/products/visual-studio-express-products) on Windows or with mono on other platforms.

Note: If you just want to update the URLs for the downloaded files you can do this by changing the values in the mbeddr-installer.exe.config. There is no need to build a new executable. _BUT_ if you change the values in the config please change the values in the App.config file accordingly. 

With Visual Studio just open the 'mbeddr-istaller.sln' and build the hole project.
With Mono just type 'xbuild /p:Configuration=Release' in this directory and you will get a release binary in './mbeddr-installer/bin/Release'

The binaries it located under mbeddr-installer/bin/Release 

Note: The binary won't run under mono because it is importing kernel space DLL from windows to perform certain operations.
